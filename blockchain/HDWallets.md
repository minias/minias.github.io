## What's HD Wallets?

### Key Takeaways

- A hierarchical deterministic wallet is a digital wallet commonly used to store the keys for holders of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- To prevent hacking these keys must be randomly generated and backed up in the wallet.
- HD wallets enable a series of key pairs to be created from one random seed, providing convenience and manageability as well as high-level security.

## Deterministic vs. Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

## Benefits and Risks of HD Wallets

## What is an Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet?[1]

> An MPC wallet uses multi-party computation technology with the intention of enhancing security for your cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. It splits a walletâ€™s private key among multiple parties to increase privacy and reduce the risks of hacking, breaches, and losses. Unlike traditional wallets that rely on a single private key, MPC Wallets use advanced cryptographic techniques to strive to ensure that the private key is never exposed or stored in one location.

## Benefits and Risks of MPC Wallets

> MPC wallets may provide several benefits, including enhanced security, flexibility, and control. They aim to enable multiple parties to participate in the management of digital assets, enabling improved security & risk mitigation, more efficient asset management & transfer, advanced access control & permissions, and streamlined collaboration between different parties. Potential risks include high communication costs and technical complexity. It's also worth noting that not all MPC wallets are open-source or interoperable, which could limit their usability and compatibility with other systems.
